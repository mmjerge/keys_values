"""Reinforcement-learning fine-tuning for KeysAndValues models.

Currently provides GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) under
:mod:`keys_values.rl.grpo`, which is built entirely on KeysAndValues
components (generation, log-prob scoring, and the policy gradient all run
through the sparse KV cache). Per-token log-probs are computed by
:func:`keys_values.logprobs.compute_logprobs`.
