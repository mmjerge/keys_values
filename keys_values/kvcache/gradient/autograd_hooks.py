class CellComputationAutogradHooks(AutogradHooks):
    """
    When running `autograd` on a cell, consisting of a number of layers and a
    number of token chunks, the largest variables are keys and values of the
    full KV cache size, with shape
    `(batch_size, n_query_groups, cache_length, head_size)`. Since these
    arise from `scatter` or `cat` with much smaller arguments, we can use
    packing and unpacking, so only a small number of these full-size tensors
    need to be stored. This is done by the autograd saved tensors hooks
    mechanism:

    https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/autograd_saved_tensors_hooks_tutorial.html

    This works as interplay with :class:`TrainingAttnWeightsReplayCache` (or
    :class:`TrainingAttnWeightsReplayCacheOld`), which implements the part of
    the forward pass where these large tensor nodes are created. Each such node
    is given an annotation of type :class:`NodeAnnotation`.

    Matching annotations to :meth:`pack_hook` arguments:

    An annotation for `x` is created when a node is created as
    `x_new = f(x, index, delta)`. It is indexed as `(l, s)`. For each `l`,
    nodes form dependency chains: `(l, s - 1) -> (l, s)`. The annotation
    contains information to reconstruct `x` from `x_new`, or to map `x` to
    the pack argument.

    One difficulty is that :meth:`pack_hook` is often called for `x` before its
    annotation is created (because `x` is used before its usage to create
    `x_new`). In :meth:`pack_hook`, we check whether the argument `x` has a shape
    of an annotated tensor. If so, it is entered into `_pack_arguments`. We then
    call :meth:`_match_annotations` in order to match `_pack_arguments` entries
    with annotations.
    This method is called in subsequent :meth:`pack_hook` calls: the goal is to
    deplete `_pack_arguments` as soon as possible, so the GPU memory for the
    pack arguments is freed. :meth:`_match_annotations` is also called when
    :meth:`unpack_hook` is called for the first time, and remaining unmatched
    pack arguments are flushed, so they will not be packed. Ideally, there
    should be no such pack arguments, and no unmatched annotations either.

    We support some differences between pack arguments and annotations, which
    may arise in MHA implementations when called for the prefill:

    * Different type: Pack argument can be `float32`, annotation can have
      a different type (`float16`, `bfloat16`).

    Roles of `index`, `delta`:

    The `index, delta` entries of an annotation serve two different purposes:
    (1) matching against pack argument, (2) reconstruction of argument during
    unpacking. When an annotation is matched against a pack argument, the
    `delta` information is not needed for (2), since it can be extracted from
    the pack argument.
    However, for "scatter" annotations, `delta` contains (2) as well. This is
    because such annotations are used even if they cannot be matched against
    any pack argument, see :meth:`_flush_remaining_pack_arguments`.

    Arguments of expected shapes which cannot be packed:

    The logic here needs to be fit to how the computation graph for the model
    is created. In particular, you need to (1) know the shapes of all possible
    packed arguments (see `_initialize_shapes`), and (2) understand whether
    there are nodes with one of these shapes which cannot be packed. If there
    are such nodes, we may want to understand when they arise.

    For (1), we need to specialize certain annotations to how SDPA is being
    computed (for example, the "ext-*" or "padded-query" kind).
    For (2), we have a mechanism to remove pack arguments which cannot be
    matched to annotations after `max_match_trials_pack_arg` calls of
    :meth:`pack_hook`. This means we only create annotations for nodes which
    we know how to pack.

    Adjusting `max_match_trials_pack_arg`:

    It is important to properly choose `max_match_trials_pack_arg`, at least
    in situations where there are a substantial number of pack arguments of
    target shapes which cannot be matched against annotations. Namely, once
    a pack argument exists for `max_match_trials_pack_arg` calls of
    :meth:`pack_hook`, it will be removed as unmatched (and not packed).

    If `max_match_trials_pack_arg` is too large, pack arguments stick around
    for longer, and there will be more overhead in failed matchings. This can
    be substantial.
    If `max_match_trials_pack_arg` is too small, pack arguments may be removed
    before they can be matched against annotations, which reduces memory
    savings, and may lead to OOM errors.

    You can adjust `max_match_trials_pack_arg` by monitoring the
    `num_unmatched_scatter_cat` field in :meth:`annotation_usage_log`. As
    long as this is 0, `max_match_trials_pack_arg` can be decreased.

    Packing for scatter with grace period:

    A special case arises for nodes arising by `scatter` when
    `grace_period > 0` and the cache is full, see :class:`AttnWeightsKVCache`.
    We have `num = num1 + num2` and `num2 = min(num, grace_period)`. The
    operation is `x_new = f(x, index, delta, positions)`, where `positions` is
    an additional 1D index of length `num2`. Namely:

        `x_new = scatter(x, index_ext, delta_ext)`
        `delta_ext = cat(x.detach()[positions], delta)`
        `index_ext = cat(index, positions)`

    We reconstruct `x` from `x_new` using `index`, `positions`, and
    `delta_rev = gather(x, index)`:

        `a = gather(x_new, index[:num2])`
        `x = scatter(x_new, cat(index, positions), cat(delta_rev, a))`

    Some annotations can be matched twice:

    There are annotations which match different pack arguments. Normally,
    annotations are removed with the first match. But if `may_match_twice` is
    given and `may_match_twice(annotation) == True`, the annotation is kept
    around, marking it with `match_id`. When matched the second time, this ID
    is returned. We also count IDs returned more than once in `_id_counts`. In
    :meth:`unpack_hook`, we store unpacked tensors in `_id_to_unpacked` so they
    can be returned once more for a duplicate.

    Dealing with different forward and backward traversal orderings:

    :meth:`pack_hook` is called along the forward traversal,
    :meth:`unpack_hook` along the backward traversal. It turns out the backward
    traversal ordering is not exactly the reverse of the forward traversal
    ordering. This is a problem: if "ext-key" (l_idx, c_idx) comes before
    "scatter-key" (l_idx, c_idx) in the backward traversal, we have noy yet
    reconstructed the input to "ext-key". We solve this by
    `prior_annotation` for the "ext-key" annotation referring to the
    "scatter-key" annotation, which can then be done earlier (and skipped
    later).

    More generally, the backward traversal may request an annotation whose
    buffer state is more than one chunk behind the current final buffer. This
    happens if autograd's backward for the intermediate chunks is served
    without unpacking their "scatter-*" / "cat-*" annotations, e.g., when a
    generated region spans three or more chunks (issue #148). In this case,
    :meth:`_unpack_from_annotation` walks the annotation chain, applying
    intermediate annotations early. Reconstructed intermediate states are
    parked in `_id_to_unpacked`, so their IDs can still be served if autograd
    asks for them later.

    Packing broadcast-extended indexes:

    A broadcast-extended index is a 4D tensor of integer dtype, obtained as
    `expand_index(index, head_size)` from a 3D index. We use such indexes a lot
    with scatter and gather. They are packed without needing annotations. Once
    a pack argument is determined to be a broadcast-extended index, it is packed
    with the 3D `index`.

    Logging:

    If `log_all_shapes` is set, we count the shapes of all nodes, as passed to
    the pack hook, both annotated ones and others. This can be used to develop
    a model for memory size.

        This helper method is called with the first :meth:`unpack_hook` call.
        It marks the boundary between forward (pack) and backward (unpack).
        We do several things here:

        - Loop over unmatched annotations of kind "scatter" or "cat", try
          to match against args in `_unmatched_pack_args`. If this does
          not succeed, append to `_packed_arg_for_id` with new IDs. This
          ensures that the "annotation chain" needed to reconstruct all
          keys and values is complete in `_packed_arg_for_id`. Even if
          a "cat" or "scatter" annotation is not matched to a pack
          argument, it may be required to serve "ext" annotations. Namely,
          it could happen that `autograd` stores an "ext" node in its
          graph, but not the associated "cat" / "scatter" node.
        - All entries in `_unmatched_pack_args` and remaining pack args are
          flushed, i.e. they are not packed.
        - Annotations with `match_id is None` are converted to a cheaper
          form for logging and clear the annotations list.
