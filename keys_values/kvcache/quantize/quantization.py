class Quantizer(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Provides quantization and de-quantization for a buffer of shape
    `shape = (batch_size, n_query_groups, cache_length, head_size)`.
    Quantized buffer and quantization states are maintained here.

    If `blocks_over_heads == False`, we use quantization blocks of
    size `head_size`, and quantization states have shape
    `(batch_size, n_query_groups, cache_length)`. If
    `blocks_over_heads == True`, we use quantization blocks of
    size `n_query_groups * head_size`, and quantization states have shape
    `(batch_size, cache_length)`. A quantizer whose backend restricts the
    block size may zero-pad the values of one (batch, slot) position and split
    them into several blocks instead (see :class:`BitsAndBytesQuantizer`), but
    a block never contains values from different positions.

    Deallocating and allocating buffers:

    If `allocate_buffers == True`, buffers are allocated when the object is
    created. If this is `False`, allocation is delayed. Buffers can be
    deallocated by calling :meth:`deallocate`, to save GPU memory when they
    are not needed.

    Note: Different to :class:`KVCacheBuffers` and subclasses, late buffer
    allocation or reallocation needs to be done by calling
    :meth:`_allocate_buffers` explicitly. It is not automatically done.

    As with :class:`DefaultKVCacheBuffers`, the device for buffers is undefined
    as long as they are not allocated, and can change with the next allocation.

    Callback to support quantizer sharing:

    In order to support sharing the same `quantizer_k`, `quantizer_v` between
    different :class:`QuantizedKVCacheBuffers` buffers, we provide the option
    of a callback of the form `callback(new_block_idx, current_block_idx)`. If
    this callback is used, we also maintain a reference to the `block_idx` of
    the calling :class:`QuantizedKVCacheBuffers` in `current_block_idx`. All
    methods called by buffers have an additional `block_idx` argument, which is
    required if the callback is used. The callback is called at the start of
    each method, passing `new_block_idx=block_idx`.
