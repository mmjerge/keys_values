    Base class for key-value (KV) caches.

    A cache is used to support inference for batches of size
    `<= max_batch_size`. This effective batch size is determined at the
    initial :meth:`forward` call for an inference (`input_pos == 0`), and
    remains the same for subsequent calls (`input_pos > 0`).

    KV cache buffers have shapes
    `(batch_size, config.n_query_groups, cache_length, head_size)`, where
    `head_size` is a parameter (defaults to `config.head_size`). Depending on
    the implementation, these buffers are allocated up front with first
    dimension `max_batch_size`, or they are re-allocated for every inference
    with the effective batch size.

    `input_pos` counts the number of tokens for which KV information has
    been cached, since the last recent :meth:`reset` call. The first call
    of :meth:`forward` after a reset (when `input_pos == 0`) is called the
    prefill call.

    * :class:`AttnWeightsKVCache`: Eviction decisions based on scores which
        require attention weights to be computed. Based on buffers.
    * :class:`KVCacheWithBuffers`: Based on buffers which can be deallocated

        a reference implementation of :meth:`forward` based on this.

        attention weights, scores for the next :meth:`forward` call need to

        than `max_prefill_length` tokens. Note that if the cache makes eviction
        decisions by scoring in :meth:`update`, then large `num` may lead to
