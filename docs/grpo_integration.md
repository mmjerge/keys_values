# GRPO Fine-tuning with KeysAndValues

This document explains how to run GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
fine-tuning on top of KeysAndValues, what you need to install, and exactly
where the KeysAndValues KV cache is used in the pipeline.

The code lives under [`keys_values/rl/`](../keys_values/rl):

```
keys_values/rl/
  logprobs.py            # memory-efficient per-token log-prob computation
  grpo/
    trainer.py           # GRPOLongContextTrainer (TRL GRPOTrainer subclass)
    loop.py              # grpo_step: standalone GRPO loop (no TRL needed)
    loss.py              # GRPOLossHeadModel: GRPO loss as a HeadModel
    rollout.py           # generate_completions: KV-cache generation adapter
```

## Why a KV cache for RL?

GRPO repeatedly (1) generates completions, (2) scores them under the sampling
policy, and (3) computes a policy gradient. For long prompts/completions, each
of these steps would normally hold the activations or attention state for the
entire sequence in GPU memory.

KeysAndValues processes sequences in **chunks** through a bounded KV cache, so
peak memory stays flat as sequence length grows. The GRPO integration routes
the memory-heavy steps through that infrastructure.

## Where the KV cache is used

This is the key question, and the answer depends on which entry point you use.

### Standalone loop (`keys_values.rl.grpo.loop.grpo_step`)

The KV cache is used at **every** memory-heavy stage — both inference and the
gradient update:

| Stage | Component | KV cache role |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1. Generation | `rollout.generate_completions` → `LongContextInferenceModel` | inference (chunked prefill + decode) |
| 2. Old (sampling) log-probs | `logprobs.compute_logprobs` (under `no_grad`) | inference (scoring) |
| 3. Policy gradient | `loss.GRPOLossHeadModel` + `LongContextGradientModel` | gradient updates (memory-bounded backward) |
| 4. Optimizer step | `torch.optim.Optimizer` | — |

So for the standalone loop the answer is **both**: the cache backs generation
and old-log-prob scoring (inference) *and* the gradient/backward pass.

### TRL trainer (`keys_values.rl.grpo.trainer.GRPOLongContextTrainer`)

This subclass plugs into TRL's `GRPOTrainer` and overrides only the per-token
log-probability computation (`_get_per_token_logps_and_entropies`), routing it
through `compute_logprobs` when a sequence is longer than `kv_cache_length`.
TRL still owns generation and the optimizer.

| Stage | Owner | KV cache role |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Generation | TRL (transformers / vLLM) | not used |
| Per-token log-probs (reference and policy) | `compute_logprobs` | inference scoring for long sequences; short sequences fall through to TRL's default with zero overhead |
| Optimizer step | TRL | — |

So for the TRL path the cache is used specifically for the **log-prob
computation** TRL depends on, on long sequences only.

## Installation

Start from a working KeysAndValues install (see the top-level
[README](../README.md) for the base setup), then:

```bash
# Base package (editable install from the repo root)
pip install -e .

# The standalone loop (keys_values.rl.grpo.loop) and logprobs need nothing
# beyond the base install — they run anywhere KeysAndValues runs, incl. CPU.

# The TRL trainer additionally needs TRL:
pip install -e .[trl]      # installs trl>=1.0.0
```

GPU is recommended for real runs but not required for the standalone loop on a
small model (the unit tests run on CPU).

## Running

### Option A — standalone loop (no TRL)

`grpo_step` runs one full GRPO optimization step on a `keys_values.model.GPT`
that has non-dense KV caches assigned. You supply prompts and a reward
function.

```python
import torch
from keys_values.model import GPT
from keys_values.kvcache.factory import KVCacheFactory
from keys_values.rl.grpo.loop import grpo_step

# model must have (non-dense) KV caches assigned
gpt_model.assign_kv_caches(
    KVCacheFactory.create(
        gpt_model=gpt_model,
        name="lastrec-default",
        max_batch_size=num_prompts * group_size,
        cache_length=cache_length,
        dtype=torch.float32,
    )
)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(gpt_model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)

def reward_fn(prompt_ids, completion_ids):
    # return a reward tensor of shape (num_prompts * group_size,)
    ...

metrics = grpo_step(
    gpt_model=gpt_model,
    prompt_ids=prompt_ids,            # (num_prompts, prompt_len), left-padded
    reward_fn=reward_fn,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    group_size=group_size,            # completions sampled per prompt
    max_new_tokens=64,
    chunk_size=16,
)
print(metrics)   # loss, mean_reward, mean_advantage, ...
```

A runnable, annotated walkthrough is in
[`examples/trl_grpo_demo.ipynb`](../examples/trl_grpo_demo.ipynb).

### Option B — TRL trainer

A drop-in `GRPOTrainer` for users already on TRL who have a KeysAndValues
model. Long sequences get the bounded-memory log-prob path; short ones use
TRL's default.

```python
from keys_values.rl.grpo.trainer import GRPOLongContextTrainer

trainer = GRPOLongContextTrainer(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    reward_funcs=my_reward_func,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    kv_cache_name="h2o-torch-quantized8",
    kv_cache_length=16384,   # sequences longer than this use the chunked path
    kv_chunk_size=1024,
)
trainer.train()
```

## Shared-prompt prefill

Every member of a GRPO group shares the same prompt, but the naive rollout
prefills it `group_size` times. With `share_prompt_prefill=True`, `grpo_step`
prefills the prompt once at batch size 1, expands the retained cache state
(KV buffers, token positions, score accumulators) to the group batch, and
keeps the decode batched. This follows the response-only-update schedule
validated by LongStraw (arXiv:2607.14952). Because KeysAndValues caches are
bounded, the retained state is small, so the expansion is a cheap row-0
broadcast.

Constraints: one prompt per step (`prompt_ids.shape[0] == 1`) and caches on
non-quantized `-default` buffers. Completions are exactly identical to the
naive schedule (token-level parity is enforced in
`test/rl/grpo/test_prefix.py` for dense, H2O, and lastrec caches).

Measured on A10G (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, bf16, eager SDPA, 7000-token prompt,
`group_size=8`, 128 new tokens, mean of 3 steps):

| cache                | gen baseline | gen shared | gen speedup | total/step |
|----------------------|-------------:|-----------:|------------:|-----------:|
| `h2o-default@4096`   |      9.8 s   |     6.4 s  |   1.53x     | 40.3 → 36.9 s |
| `dense-default@7200` |      9.4 s   |     8.1 s  |   1.16x     | 18.0 → 16.7 s |

The saving is `(G-1)/G` of the prefill cost; the remaining generation time is
the (serial) decode, so the speedup grows with prompt length and group size
and shrinks with `max_new_tokens`. Peak memory is unchanged (buffers are
sized for the group batch either way). Reproduce with
`examples/grpo_prefill_bench.py`.

## Tests

```bash
pytest test/rl/
```

The suite runs on CPU with a tiny model and exercises the full pipeline:
generation → reward → advantages → old log-probs → policy gradient →
optimizer step.
