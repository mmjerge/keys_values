# vLLM Integration

Status: **early spike** (branch `vllm-integration`)

Target vLLM version: **0.23.0** (latest), running on the **V1 engine**.

> History: this was originally scoped against vLLM 0.6.5 (the version in the
> reference docs). We retargeted to 0.23 because 0.6.5 hard-pins
> `torch==2.5.1`, which conflicts with LitGPT (`torch>=2.7`) and would have
> forced a second environment. vLLM 0.23 resolves onto a recent torch (2.11
> in our setup), so **a single env can hold vLLM + LitGPT + keys_values**. The
> tradeoff: the engine internals are completely different (V0 → V1), so the
> old `AttentionBackend`/`AttentionImpl` extension map no longer applies.

### Why target the latest stable, and what it costs

Agreed: we track the most recent stable vLLM and do not try to stay compatible
with older lines. Integrating against the latest is *easier* on the axis that
matters most here — dependencies. A recent vLLM resolves onto a recent torch,
so vLLM + LitGPT + keys_values share one environment (the original driver for
the retarget).

The drawback is not difficulty of integration but **stability of the seams we
hook**. The V1 extension points we rely on (`KVCacheSpec`, the
`SingleTypeKVCacheManager` family, `GPUModelRunner.get_kv_cache_spec`, the
`register_custom_kv_cache_specs` platform hook) are engine internals, not a
frozen public plugin API. They can and do shift between minor releases, so:

- We pin a known-good vLLM (currently 0.23.0) and bump deliberately, not
  automatically.
- We keep the bridge surface small and isolated in `keys_values/vllm/` so a
  vLLM bump touches few files.
- Parity tests (phase 4) guard against silent behavior drift after a bump.

So "harder against the recent one" is really "we accept a moving-target
internal API in exchange for a single, modern environment" — a good trade for
this library, which has no reason to serve on an old vLLM.

## Goal

Bring this library's *selective KV cache policies* (H2O, qH2O, smart-lastrec,
lastrec, ...) to vLLM, so users can run long-context inference with advanced
cache eviction while benefiting from vLLM's serving stack. Reuse vLLM's fast
kernels and multi-device machinery; plug in our cache abstractions and eviction
policies.

This is **not** primarily a "register a new model" task. vLLM ships its own
implementations of Qwen2/Llama/etc. (in `vllm/model_executor/models/`) and loads
HF weights into them — LitGPT is never in the serving path. The work lives at
the **KV cache + attention layer**.

**Design principle — minimize what we impose on users.** Users should get only
the part that is genuinely ours and not already in vLLM: the selective
eviction policies (H2O, qH2O, smart-lastrec, ...). Anything vLLM already does
well — paging, scheduling, kernels, model loading — we reuse rather than
re-implement or wrap. Concretely: no forked vLLM, no custom model registration
where vLLM's own model works, and the bridge stays torch-only and litgpt-free
so it adds no LitGPT footprint to a serving environment. The ideal user-facing
surface is a single policy/config flag.

## Environment

One combined env (no more split):

```bash
pip install -U vllm          # 0.23.0, pulls torch 2.11
pip install -e .             # keys_values (torch-free deps)
pip install -U outlines      # clears a stale 0.6.5-era pin
```

Verify: `python -c "import torch, vllm, litgpt, keys_values.kvcache.base"`.
LitGPT (`torch>=2.7`) and vLLM 0.23 (torch 2.11) coexist; the keys_values
`kvcache/` module is pure torch (zero litgpt imports), so it slots into either.

## The impedance mismatch (still the core problem)

| Concern | keys_values | vLLM V1 |
|---|---|---|
| Cache layout | dense `(batch, n_query_groups, cache_length, head_size)` + `token_pos` | paged blocks; per-layer `KVCacheSpec` (block_size, num_kv_heads, head_size, dtype) |
| Eviction granularity | per `(batch, head, slot)` | per block, via a `KVCacheManager` / block pool |
| Eviction decision | inside `KVCache.forward`, H2O needs **attention weights** | block managers decide by position/recency; kernels don't return weights |
| Attention call | `KVCache.forward(query, key, value, token_idx)` does evict + SDPA | model calls `Attention` layer; V1 attention backend + metadata builder |

Two hard constraints persist:
1. **Attention weights.** H2O scores slots by summed attention weight; vLLM
   kernels don't expose them. keys_values already solves this for its own stack
   (`keys_values/attention/`, `kvcache/attn_weights.py` — vendored FlashInfer +
   Triton score-sum). That has to be reachable from the vLLM attention path.
2. **Granularity.** vLLM evicts whole blocks; our policies score per `(head,
   slot)`. Block-level eviction can't reproduce per-head H2O exactly.

## vLLM paged KV layout: what a "block" is

This answers the questions raised in review about how vLLM stores KV and how it
differs from the dense keys_values layout.

**Dense (keys_values).** One dense tensor per layer,
`(batch, n_query_groups, cache_length, head_size)`, plus `token_pos` of shape
`(batch, n_query_groups, cache_length)` recording which logical token sits in
each slot. Eviction is per `(batch, head, slot)`: any single slot can be
overwritten independently.

**Paged (vLLM V1).** KV is stored in fixed-size **blocks** drawn from a shared
pool. For one KV cache group (a set of layers with the same spec) the physical
storage is, per layer, a tensor shaped like:

```
(2, num_blocks, block_size, num_kv_heads, head_size)
 ^K/V  ^pool     ^tokens/blk ^heads       ^feature
```

A **block** is therefore a contiguous slab holding `block_size` consecutive
tokens' keys and values for **all** KV heads of that layer. In the spike
(Qwen2.5-0.5B) `block_size = 16`, `num_kv_heads = 2`, `head_size = 64`,
`num_gpu_blocks = 102197`.

**Indexing.** To address a single KV vector you need:
`(layer/group, physical block_id, offset ∈ [0, block_size), kv_head, feature)`.
A request does not own a dense range; it owns a **block table** per group — an
ordered list of physical `block_id`s. A logical token at position `t` maps as:

```
logical_block = t // block_size
physical_block = block_table[logical_block]
offset         = t % block_size
```

Blocks are reference-counted in the `BlockPool`; "eviction" means returning a
block to the pool (and, for prefix caching, possibly sharing it across
requests).

**Granularity (the line-56 question).** The smallest allocatable / evictable
unit is **one block = `block_size` tokens (16 here), for an entire layer across
all KV heads**, uniform within a KV cache group. It is a per-model config value,
not something we choose per policy. Two consequences for us:

- **Per-request length can vary** — each sequence has its own block table and
  its own block count, so effective `cache_length` differs per request. This is
  the one axis where vLLM is *more* flexible than our dense form.
- **Per-head length cannot vary** — the block table and `block_size` are shared
  across all KV heads in a layer, so you cannot free a block for one head while
  keeping it for another. This is exactly why faithful per-head H2O is
  impossible at block granularity and pushes H2O toward either a block-level
  approximation (Option A) or the dense-cache backend (Option B).

Positional policies (lastrec, smart-lastrec) only need to decide *which logical
positions to drop*, which maps cleanly onto freeing blocks — so they fit the
paged model well. Score-based per-head policies (H2O) are the hard case.

## vLLM 0.23 / V1 extension points (mapped from source)

KV cache description — `vllm/v1/kv_cache_interface.py`:
- `KVCacheSpec` (frozen dataclass, base): `block_size`, `page_size_bytes`,
  `max_memory_usage_bytes(...)`. Custom specs register via
  `@register_kv_cache_spec`.
- `AttentionSpec(KVCacheSpec)`: `num_kv_heads`, `head_size`, `dtype`,
  `kv_quant_mode`.
- `FullAttentionSpec`, `SlidingWindowSpec`, `ChunkedLocalAttentionSpec`,
  `MLAAttentionSpec`, `MambaSpec`, ... — **these are the precedent**: vLLM V1
  already expresses non-full-attention cache patterns as first-class specs.
- `KVCacheConfig`: `num_blocks`, `kv_cache_tensors`, `kv_cache_groups`.
- `KVCacheGroupSpec`: layers sharing one block table.

KV cache management — `vllm/v1/core/`:
- `kv_cache_manager.py` (`KVCacheManager`), `block_pool.py`,
  `single_type_kv_cache_manager.py` with `SlidingWindowManager`,
  `ChunkedLocalAttentionManager` — per-pattern managers that free/reuse blocks
  according to the policy. **This is where selective eviction lives in V1.**

Attention — `vllm/v1/attention/backends/`:
- Per-backend metadata builders (flash_attn, flashinfer, triton_attn, ...) plus
  the `Attention` layer the model calls. Backend choice via
  `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND`.

Model / registration:
- `ModelRegistry` / out-of-tree plugins via entry points (only needed if we
  register a custom model; likely we reuse vLLM's Qwen2 + a custom cache path).

## Candidate architectures (revised for V1)

**Option A — custom `KVCacheSpec` + `SingleTypeKVCacheManager`.** Model the
keys_values policy as a V1 cache spec (à la `SlidingWindowSpec`) with a manager
(à la `SlidingWindowManager`) that frees blocks per the eviction policy. This is
the idiomatic V1 path and reuses vLLM's paged kernels. Works cleanly for
**positional** policies (lastrec, sliding-window-like). Limitation: eviction is
per-block, not per-head, and there are no attention weights — so it cannot do
faithful H2O on its own.

**Option B — custom attention backend owning a dense cache.** A V1 attention
backend that bypasses paged storage and keeps keys_values' dense buffers +
`token_pos`, running our SDPA + per-head eviction (and, for H2O, our
attention-weight kernels). Highest fidelity, but fights vLLM's memory manager
and CUDA-graph/scheduler assumptions. Highest effort.

**Recommendation:** start with **Option A + `lastrec`** — positional, no
attention weights, maps directly onto the `SlidingWindowManager` pattern. This
proves the data flow end-to-end with idiomatic V1 machinery (done in task 2.3).
Next, extend to **`smart-lastrec`** — still positional and weight-free, but with
per-request (batch-dependent, not head-dependent) initial regions, which is the
first policy that is genuinely unique to keys_values. Only then evaluate
whether H2O can be approximated at block granularity (Option A) or needs the
dense-cache backend (Option B).

## Spike results (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, 1× A10G, vLLM 0.23.0 / V1)

Captured by `examples/vllm_spike.py`:
- Architecture: `Qwen2ForCausalLM`; engine: V1; dtype: bfloat16.
- Resolved attention backend: **FLASH_ATTN** (FlashAttention 2). Available on
  this GPU: `['FLASH_ATTN', 'FLASHINFER', 'TRITON_ATTN', 'FLEX_ATTENTION']`.
- Cache geometry: `num_kv_heads=2`, `head_size=64`, `num_layers=24`,
  `block_size=16`, `num_gpu_blocks=102197`, `cache_dtype=auto`.
- KV cache capacity: 1,635,152 tokens; max concurrency 798x at 2048 tokens.
- Generation works; engine init (profile + warmup) took ~161 s (one-time).

Implications:
- FlashAttention 2 does **not** return attention weights → confirms H2O (phase 3)
  needs a different path. FLASHINFER is available, which aligns with the
  FlashInfer machinery keys_values already uses for the weight-sum path.
- GQA: 2 KV heads, head_size 64, 24 layers → the per-layer `KVCacheSpec` we
  define must match `FullAttentionSpec(block_size=16, num_kv_heads=2,
  head_size=64, dtype=bf16)`.

## Phased plan

1. **Feasibility spike** (DONE): see results above. Script: `examples/vllm_spike.py`.
2. **lastrec via Option A** (DONE, task 2.3): custom `KVCacheSpec` + manager;
   output parity vs. native sliding window confirmed (see below).
3. **smart-lastrec via Option A** (NEXT): the recommended next policy. It is
   genuinely *not* something vLLM already provides, and — crucially — it needs
   **no attention weights**, so it sidesteps the hardest constraint for now. Its
   eviction decisions depend on the **batch** dimension (per-request initial /
   "grace" regions) but **not** on head position, which fits the paged
   block model: per-request block tables already give us per-request variation,
   and we never need to diverge across heads. Implement `SmartLastRecManager` as
   a subclass of `LastRecManager` (`keys_values/vllm/managers.py` is structured
   to extend here). Upstream `smart-lastrec` is being refactored for left
   padding; align the bridge with that once it lands.
4. **H2O**: only after the positional policies land. Decide block-granularity
   approximation vs. dense-cache backend; route attention-weight computation
   through the existing FlashInfer + Triton score-sum machinery.
5. **Eval + parity tests** vs. the LitGPT inference path, then long-context
   benchmarks.

## Serve-time wiring result (task 2.3)

`lastrec` now runs end-to-end in vLLM 0.23 (V1) and is at output parity with
native sliding window. Mechanism (see `examples/vllm_lastrec_experiment.py`):

- Run the engine in-process (`VLLM_ENABLE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING=0`) so monkeypatches
  apply to the worker.
- Set each `Attention` layer's `sliding_window` to the window size (an **int** —
  a tuple breaks `SlidingWindowSpec.max_admission_blocks_per_request`). vLLM then
  derives a `SlidingWindowSpec` for each layer and masks attention to the window.
- Wrap `GPUModelRunner.get_kv_cache_spec` to convert each derived
  `SlidingWindowSpec` into our `LastRecSpec`, which routes to `LastRecManager`.

Verified on 1x A10G, Qwen2.5-0.5B, window 256: `lastrec` output is byte-identical
to `sliding` for the same prompt/seed. Note: a needle-recall test does NOT
discriminate at window 256, because info diffuses forward ~`window x num_layers`
(~6k tokens) through the residual stream; use a small window (e.g. 32) to make
eviction observable.

Open follow-up: this uses monkeypatches in an experiment harness. A production
path should register via the `register_custom_kv_cache_specs` platform hook and a
config flag rather than patching `get_kv_cache_spec`/layer attributes.

## H2O wiring (task 4.3): findings and plan

Two sub-problems must be solved to run H2O in-engine; investigation status:

### Blocker 1 - attention weights in-engine (tractable)
H2O scores need per-KV-position attention mass. FlashAttention (the default
backend) exposes nothing. But vLLM's **V1 FlashInfer backend** runs its wrappers
with `return_lse=True` (`vllm/v1/attention/backends/flashinfer.py`), yielding the
per-query log-sum-exp. With `LSE + Q + K`, per-position weights are
`exp(q_i·k_j·scale - lse_i)` - the same Q,K,LSE recipe keys_values' FlashInfer
path already uses, and summable with the existing Triton score-sum. So the plan
is: force FlashInfer, capture LSE per layer, compute the per-position score-sum,
and feed `H2OManager.record_block_scores`.

Step 1 confirmed on box (g5.xlarge, vLLM 0.23): FlashInfer is selected via the
`EngineArgs` field `attention_backend="FLASHINFER"` (the old
`VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND` env var is gone in 0.23). Forward hooks on the 24
`Attention` layers install and fire during generation, and output stays correct.
Foundation harness: `examples/vllm_h2o_probe.py`. Remaining step-2 work: the
layer forward hook sees Q/output but not LSE, which lives inside the FlashInfer
impl's run path - so LSE capture needs a hook one level down (on the FlashInfer
`AttentionImpl.forward` / wrapper `.run`), not the module hook.

### Blocker 2 - non-prefix eviction in the block table (the hard part)
vLLM's built-in managers only ever free a contiguous **prefix** (sliding window,
chunked-local), replacing it with null blocks; attention then runs over the
suffix. H2O evicts arbitrary **middle** blocks, leaving holes the block table +
FlashInfer masking don't natively represent, and V1 block tables are designed
append-only. Candidate approaches, to evaluate empirically:
- **A. Block-table compaction**: drop the evicted block from the request's list.
  The stored K keeps its original RoPE (position is baked into K, not the list
  index), so attention over the remaining blocks uses correct encodings - this
  is promising, but `slot_mapping`/`seq_len`/causal-mask metadata must be made
  consistent, against an append-only assumption.
- **B. Dense-cache attention backend (Option B)**: faithful per-head eviction,
  most invasive.

### Recommended 4.3 order
1. Wire blocker 1 first (LSE capture -> score-sum -> `record_block_scores`) and
   verify scores look sane during generation; this is reusable regardless of how
   eviction is wired.
2. Prototype approach A (compaction) on short sequences; compare against the
   keys_values/LitGPT H2O reference. If compaction can't be made consistent with
   V1 metadata, escalate to Option B.

## Open questions

- Can a `SingleTypeKVCacheManager` express keys_values eviction without touching
  the block pool internals?
- H2O at block granularity — acceptable accuracy, or is per-head eviction
  (Option B) required?
- Getting summed attention weights in V1 without a custom kernel per backend.
- CUDA-graph capture with a dynamically-evicting custom manager.
